@6011   = ~When wizards first learn to use magic, before deciding whether to specialize, they are taught some of the most basic and minor effects from each school.

A wizard may use a Cantrip Wand as a ranged weapon, casting a Magic Bolt at an enemy once per round, which does 1d4+1 magic damage. (Note, while doing so the wizard will be at a tactical disadvantage against nearby attackers using melee weapons.) Alternatively, the wizard can use the wand to cast one of the following cantrips:
- Deflective Shell: blocks one 1st- through 3rd level spell targeting the wizard. The Shell last 3 rounds.
- Conjure Rabbit: conjures a small rodent near the wizard, which lasts for 3 rounds.
- Glimpse: gives the wizard a brief (2-second) look at another area of the map.
- Drowse: the target will fall asleep for 1 round on a failed save vs. Spells.
- Bedazzle: the target suffers a -1 penalty to thac0 and AC for 1 round; on a failed save vs. Breath, the penalties are doubled and last for 2 rounds, and the target is blinded for the first round.
- Stiffen Bones: the target suffers from painful stiffness, suffering a -1 penalty to thac0 and damage for 1 round; on a failed save vs. Death, the penalties are doubled and last for 2 rounds, and the target is Slowed for the first round.
- Earthen Grasp: the target will be entangled, unable to move, for 2 rounds on a failed save vs. Petrification.~

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell causes the surface of the ground to take on a slippery, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.~
@6112  = ~Protection From Evil
(Divination)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~
@6113  = ~Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~
@6114  = ~Glitterdust
(Illusion)

Level: 2
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell was created by a Conjurer who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. This spell showers glittering golden particles in the area of effect. Enemies must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~
@6115  = ~Luck
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this gains a very slight, instinctive insight into the immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to be lucky in every regard for the next 3 rounds, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.~
@6116  = ~Flame Arrow
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts, superheats them, and then hurls fiery bolts at opponents at very high speed. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.~
@6117  = ~Greater Malison
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: 50 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The spell grants the caster the ability to understand and subtly manipulate the flow of time, making any following spells more likely to be successful and effective. The practical result is to adversely affect all enemy Saving Throws. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect, who make all saving throws at a penalty of -4.~
@6118  = ~Shadow Stalker
(Illusion/Phamtasm)

Level: 6
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a double of the caster formed from pure shadow, and imparts upon it some degree of form and autonomy. Blurry and shapeless, this entity will fight on the caster's behalf and remain in relatively stable form for up to 9 hours (unless it meets a violent demise).~
@6119  = ~Mordenkainen's Sword
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. The sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. (This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.) The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 5d4 points of damage upon hitting a target.~
@6120  = ~Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
(Necromancy) 

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~
@6121  = ~Black Blade of Disaster
(Enchantment/Charm) 

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster becomes a Grand Master in the use of the weapon. It acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~
@6122  = ~Weird
(Illusion/Phantasm) 

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~
@6123  = ~Wizard Eye
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the result of a Necromancer dipping his toes into the Diviner's sphere of influence. With it, an actual eyeball is enchanted to float around and send visual information to the caster's mind. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~
@6124   = ~Discorporate~
@6125   = ~Discorporate
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole.  The target creature must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell or burst into a million small particles, resembling dust. This effect is instantaneous and irreversible.~
@6126   = ~Energy Drain~
@6127   = ~Energy Drain
(Necromancy) 

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~
@6128  = ~Protection From Evil
Level: 2
School: Divination
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. It sprays a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.~

Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes a number of illusory duplicates of himself to come into being around him. The spell creates two images plus one for every 3 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level). These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Reflected Image spell, and casting the spell multiple times will not multiply the number of images created.~

The recipient of this gains a very slight, instinctive insight into the immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to be lucky in every regard for the next 3 rounds, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts (one for every two experience levels, up to a maximum of five arrows at level 10), superheats them, and then hurls them at opponents at very high speed. Each arrow inflicts 1d6 points of missile damage plus 2d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. breath at -2. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the wizard, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within range.~

The spell grants the caster the ability to understand and subtly manipulate the flow of time, making any following spells more likely to be successful and effective. The practical result is to adversely affect all enemy Saving Throws. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect, who make all saving throws at a penalty of -2.~

This spell is the result of a Necromancer dipping his toes into the Diviner's sphere of influence. With it, an actual eyeball is enchanted to float around and send visual information to the caster's mind. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole. Upon contact, the target must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster, until the spell duration expires or the sword is dispelled. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and attacks on its own once each round, inflicting 5d4 damage when it hits a target. It has 100% resistance to almost all forms of damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, poison, etc.), and 95% resistance to physical damage, but it is vulnerable to pure magic damage. The sword is immune to mind affecting spells, has 36 hit points, AC 5, and THAC0 2. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.~

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently.  These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill.  These effects last for 1 hour.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, and there is no saving throw to avoid the Drain.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

This spell creates a rough facsimile of the caster, recognizable though not perfect. The shadow clone has 40% of the caster's hit points and 7-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level.  The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated), and may not cast priest spells. The clone can however replicate some small amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast any 1st level spells the caster memorized that day.

This spell is cast very quickly, creating a reasonable copy of the caster that can be perceived by all five senses of any onlookers. The clone has 60% of the caster's hit points, and 5-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level. The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated), and may not cast priest spells. The clone can however replicate a moderate amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast any spells the caster memorized that day, up to 4th spell level. At the time the clone is created, the caster is rendered invisible for 60 seconds. Onlookers who do not carefully scrutinize the effect might easily believe the clone IS the caster, and the caster may use the distraction to escape or move to some advantageous position.

This is an improvement on the Lesser Simulacrum spell. The clone created has 75% of the caster's hit points, and 3-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level. The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated). The clone can, however replicate a substantial amount of the caster's magical abilities, able to cast any arcane spells the caster memorized that day, up to 7th spell level. Additionally, the clone is so real and has such a sense of identity that it can successfully use divine magic (if the caster has such capabilities). Upon casting, the caster is affected by Improved Invisibility, able to move unnoticed and even attack or cast spells without becoming fully visible.

This powerful spell creates a clone of the target creature, similar to the 8th-level Simulacrum spell. The clone created has 75% of the target creature's hit points, and 3-point penalties on to-hit rolls and effective caster level (if relevant). The clone may not use consumable items like potions or scrolls (which are not truly replicated). The clone can, however replicate a substantial amount of the target's arcane magical abilities, if the target has any - able to cast any arcane spells memorized that day, up to 7th spell level.

This spell renders the caster invisible, except for <PRO_HISHER> shadow. Moreover, the shadow can move apart from the caster and, while it cannot perform any actions like attacking or casting spells, it can move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. The caster will be protected by this invisibility as long as the shadow has not been destroyed, but will be rendered visible if the shadow is killed or dispelled.

A Grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Breath again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: <PRO_HISHER> thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. The target suffers 1d4 points of damage, +1 point for each 3 levels of the caster, to a maximum of 1d4+6 points of fire damage. A creature that successfully saves vs. Breath receives half damage.

Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails his Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible, except the charmed person cannot be compelled to violence.

If the charmed person is harmed, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed. 

Anyone who has been the target of this spell - whether they make their saving throw or not - will be suspicious for a time, and cannot be affected by it for 8 hours.

This 1st-level spell attempts to temporarily blind its target with a flash of light. A Saving Throw is allowed and, if successful, the target merely suffers a -1 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack rolls, Armor Class, and damage rolls for two rounds. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the victim is also partially blinded, <PRO_HESHE> resulting in reduced range of vision and a -4 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack rolls and Armor Class. This blindness also wears off after two rounds.

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular low-level spells, creates glowing missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort.

Similar to Mordenkainen's 'Force Missiles' variant, this is an attempt to improve on the basic Magic Missile spell. This version creates between one and five missiles of sizzling magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4 points of damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage (the victim may save vs. Breath to avoid the fire damage). For every 3 extra levels of experience after 1st level, the wizard gains an additional missile - 2 at 4th level, 3 at 7th level, 4 at 10th level, and a maximum of 5 at 13th level.

The Shield spell will block this, just as it blocks the lesser Magic Missile spell.

Each missile will inflict 1d4+1 points of damage.

This is less a spell than a release of pure wild energy. Magic energy surrounds wild mages and courses through them. This effect is what happens if a wild mage loses control and allows such energy to be unleashed. There is no spell, no intended form the magic takes; only pure, random, magical manifestation.

Wild mages may release this energy at any time, as often as they like; but most spend their careers learning how to prevent it happening, rather than how to make it happen.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical, which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.

When this spell is cast, name and enchantments (including curses) of one item or weapon subsequently touched by the caster are revealed without fail. This gives the caster insight into the history, nature, enchantments, and use of the item. Many unidentified items can still be used, but at great risk.

At 5th, 9th, and 13th level, the number of items that can be identified by this spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of 4 items at 13th level).

@8002  = ~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard, scout, or spy. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

A familiar is more intelligent than others of its type. Its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life, allows it to regenerate 1 hit point per round, and to resist petrification and level drain effects. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

At 1st level, all familiars share the following characteristics: 9 hit points, AC 4, thac0 17, saving throws 16, 25% magic and damage resistance, immunity to level drain and petrification. At certain experience thresholds - 5,000 / 50,000 / 150,000 / 450,000 / 1,250,000 / 2,500,000 / 4,000,000 - the familiar's hit points, AC, thac0 and saving throws will improve.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player may choose:

Pseudo Dragon
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d3 damage; save or be Slowed for 2 rounds
- Special Abilities: can cast Blur and Cure Light Wounds, and use a Color Spray breath weapon, once every 3 turns.
- Special Benefit: the pseudodragon's summoner regenerates 1 hit point per round.

Ferret
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d3 damage
- Special Abilities: has 80% Pick Pockets score. Can emit a small aura of Nauseating Stench once per turn. For five round, enemies near the ferret must save or suffer 2-point penalties to hit and AC and a 30% chance of casting failure.
- Special Benefit: the ferret's summoner has a +1 bonus to Constitution.

Rabbit
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d2 damage
- Special Abilities: has 80% Detect Traps score. Can burrow into the ground to escape danger - similar to the Shadowstep ability - once per turn.
- Special Benefit: the rabbit's summoner is immune to Slow effects.

Cat
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d3 damage
- Special Abilities: has 99% in Move Silently/Hide in Shadows, and is Nondetectable (as the spell) to magic divinations.
- Special Benefit: the cat's summoner has a +1 bonus to Dexterity.

Spider
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d2 damage; save or take 3 poison damage over 1 round
- Special Abilities: can cast a single-target Web, which can tangle the target for 3 rounds, once per 5 rounds.
- Special Benefit: the spider's summoner has an extra chance to resist being affected by poisons.

Rat
- Combat: 1 attack per round for 1d2 damage; save or be diseased for 3 rounds, with reduced Strength and a 30% chance of casting failure
- Special Abilities: can summon a cohort of 1d6 more rats to defend it, once per 3 turns.
- Special Benefit: the rat's summoner has a +1 bonus to Intelligence.

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points). Its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life and prevents it from truly dying. If the familiar should 'die' in combat the caster may cast Find Familiar again a day later to re-summon it.

~
@8011  = ~Pseudodragon~
@8012  = ~Pseudodragon: this is a tiny, distant relative of full dragons. The pseudodragon can cast Cure Light Wounds, and Blur, and use a colorful 'breath weapon' that mimics the Color Spray spell, once every 3 turns. (At high levels, the Blur improves to a full Improved Invisibility effect.) They can attack twice per round and while their claws are small, they deliver a mild intoxicant which can render the target drowsy and clumsy (mimicking the effects of a Slow spell, for two rounds). 

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner regenerates 1 hit point per round.

As pseudodragons can fly, they are impervious to the effects of Grease, Entangle, Web, and similar spells. As with all familiars, their magical connection to the life force of their master renders them immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8013  = ~Pseudodragon~
@8014  = ~Pseudodragon: pseudodragons are quite intelligent. While small, they are  quick and fairly well-armored. They do not do much damage in combat, but their magical claws are able to render some enemies unconscious. It is also quite resistant to magical spells.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner will slowly regenerate health.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8015  = ~Dog~
@8016  = ~Dog: ...~
@8017  = ~Ferret~
@8018  = ~Ferret: these animals are clever and mischievous, and while cute, they can occasionally carry a noxious stench. In combat they can attack twice per round, and they can emit a small-range nauseating aura which can cause nearby enemies to gag and retch, resulting in 2-point penalties to hit and armor class, and a 30% chance of spell failure.

Ferrets are also sneaky, and can make effective pickpockets on behalf of their masters.  

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner benefits from a +1 bonus to Constitution.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8019  = ~Rabbit~
@8020  = ~Rabbit: while the rabbit is not an impressive combatant, it is exceedingly skilled at avoiding damage. Rabbits have 25% resistance to elemental attacks, and once per turn they can burrow into the ground and move unheeded to a safe area (in practice this resembles the ShadowStep ability of Shadowdancers). Rabbits also have an acute sense of imending danger, and can quite effectively use their sensitive noses and ears to sniff out nearby traps.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner is immune to Slow spells and similar effects.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8021  = ~Cat~
@8022  = ~Cat: a black cat is a very traditional familiar for wizards, and is quite useful as a scout. They can move unseen as well as any master thief; and they may escape notice even in the face of spells that expose invisible creatures (though creatures with the natural ability to see hidden and invisible beings can still spot a cat).

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner benefits from a +1 bonus to Dexterity.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8023  = ~Imp~
@8024  = ~Imp: ~
@8025  = ~Spider~
@8026  = ~Spider: a spider can make a useful, if somewhat creepy-crawly, familiar for a wizard with no aversion to arachnids. They are effective in combat, especially against spellcasters, as they inject victims with a poison that can inflict 3 extra points of damage over 6 seconds. This particular variety of large spiders has the ability to, once every 5 rounds, spit a sticky mess of webbing at an enemy, who may be held fast in it for 3 rounds on a failed saving throw.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner has an extra chance to save to avoid spells or effects that cause poison damage.

Spiders cannot be held fast by Web spells or similar effects. As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8027  = ~Mephit~
@8028  = ~Mephit: ...~
@8029  = ~Quasit~
@8030  = ~Quasit: ...~
@8031  = ~Rat~
@8032  = ~Rat: rats are unusually intelligent and sociable creatures, especially when enhanced by the magic of this spell. Once per 3 turns, this familiar may call upon 1d6 fellow rats to join it in combat. Rats, even domesticated ones are also no strangers to garbage and disease, and may utilize this against their enemies. Each time they successfully strike an enemy, the victim may become diseased, resulting in a short period of weakness and a 25% chance of spell failure.

While this familiar is near its master, the summoner benefits from a +1 bonus to Intelligence.

As with all familiars, its magical connection to the life force of its master renders it immune to petrification and level drain effects.
~
@8111  = ~Nauseating Stench~
@8113  = ~Web Attack~
@8115  = ~Swarm of Rats~
@8201  = ~You can imbue your familiar with one of the following spells.  Please note, this will reduce the number of spells you can cast, and the change is permanent!~
@8202  = ~Do not transfer any spells to the familiar at this time.~
@8203  = ~Imbue Familiar~
@8204  = ~Add this spell to the familiar~
@8205  = ~Choose a different spell~
@8206  = ~Imbue Familiar

This ability can be used to imbue a familiar with the ability to cast spells. The spells are chosen from those known by the caster.  A 1st-level spell may be imbued when the caster is level 1; a 2nd-level or lower spell at level 3; a 3rd-level or lower spell at level 6; a 4th-level or lower spell at level 10, and a 5th-level or lower spell at level 15. 

Once a familiar is imbued with the ability to cast a spell, it will be able to cast the spell once per combat encounter. Each time a familier is so imbued, the choice is permanent and cannot be undone.

When cast upon a creature, its skin takes on the appearance of rough, woody bark. What's more, this bark-like texture continually grows to protect the recipient of the spell. The bark can completely turn aside a single blow (but not any magical secondary effects) and is chipped off in the process; one round later, the bark will regrow enough to block another blow. This process of protection and regrowth continues for 2 turns, protecting the recipient from one physical attack per round, after which the spell fades. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

With this spell, the caster causes a bunch of enchanted berries to grow to unnatural size, and distributes them among <PRO_HISHER> allies. Each portion is as filling and nutritious as a full home-cooked meal, and the enchantment makes them unusually restorative: partaking of the berries eliminates intoxication, reduces fatigue, and causes the eater to regenerate 2 hit points per round, for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level (to a maximum of 20 hit points healed over 10 rounds).

Creating and eating the Goodberries can only be done outside of combat.

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, traps include glyphs and similar spells or devices.

Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. Due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from Strength do not apply, but attacks with the moonblade are considered melee touch attacks, and thus gain a +4 bonus to hit.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage. There is a 50% chance that someone struck by the Moonblade will be affected by Faerie Fire if they fail a saving throw vs. spells, resulting in a 2-point penalty to armor class and preventing them from going invisible. Undead, who are particularly susceptible to the blade's radiant energy, take additional 1d12 points of damage and must make a saving throw or be Slowed for three rounds.

When Stinking Cloud is cast, a billowing mass of nauseous vapors appears centered on a point selected by the caster. Each round a creature is within the cloud, <PRO_HISHER> movement rate is cut by 50% for two rounds. Additionally, if the <PRO_HESHE> fails a saving throw vs. death/poison, <PRO_HESHE> will become nauseated. Nauseated characters are unable to attack or cast spells for two rounds, and have 2-point penalties to armor class, to-hit rolls, and casting speed for four rounds. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, apart from the movement rate reduction; however, those who remain within the cloud must continue to save each round.  Certain creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud, including all undead and creatures who don't need to breathe, such as elementals.

Saving Throw: Neg.

A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 15 ft. in radius (roughly the same size as a Fireball). Creatures caught within the webs can become stuck among the gluey fibers; they must roll a saving throw every round. If the saving throw is successful, then the creature is free to move out of the area, though at a reduced (by half) movement speed. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs and are affected as if by a Slow spell: <PRO_HESHE> performs all actions at half the usual speed and suffers a -4 penalty to armor class, and additionally c annot make any physical attacks at all. This Slow effect is compounded by the movement speed penalty, so creatures who fail their saving throw can only move at one-quarter speed to escape the webbed area.

Similar to Mordenkainen's 'Force Missiles' variant, this is an attempt to improve on the basic Magic Missile spell. This version creates two missiles of sizzling magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4 points of magic damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage (the victim may save vs. Breath to avoid the fire damage). The spell will create three missiles at 4th level, four missiles at 6th level, five missiles at 8th level, and six missiles at 10th level.

The Shield spell will block this, just as it blocks the lesser Magic Missile spell.

Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d6 Hit Points of damage per hit, and it can hit creatures that require +1 weapons to hit. It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff releases sonic energy with each hit; the effect is not strong enough to do damage outright, but it can deafen the target for three rounds on a failed saving throw vs. spells. The Decastave also has a weak vampiric effect, draining a target of 1d2 Hit Points with every strike. These Hit Points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points beyond <PRO_HISHER> normal maximum.

When this spell is cast, it will dispel one spell protection on all enemies within the area of effect. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The spell protections dispelled by Spell Thrust include: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen and Spell Shield. 

This spell has no effect on a target protected by Spell Trap or Shield of the Archons.

Surges of negative energy render all hostile living creatures in the spell's area fatigued. Fatigued individuals have 2-point reductions to attacks rolls and damage dealt by weapons, and take 2 points per die more damage from enemy spells. Such individuals will also have any Haste effects removed. Furthermore, if someone affected by this spell fails a saving throw vs. petrification/polymorph, <PRO_HESHE> will also endure a 2-point penalty to all saving throws, a reduction of 1 attack per 2 rounds, and a 2-point penalty to spellcasting speed.

Area of Effect: Special

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the caster's hand. The silent, blade-shaped construct inflicts a combination of psychic/stunning damage and magic damage. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with it, at <PRO_HISHER> normal THAC0.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. Due to its etheric nature, it causes spellcasters struck to be unable to use magic for one round. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.

Saving Throw: n/a

When this powerful spell is cast, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding the caster. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder <PRO_HIMHER> in no way. Five such protective skins are gained, plus one for every two levels of the caster. For example, a 10th level wizard would receive 10 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 15. Each skin will stop one physical attack and then disappear, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 10 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 11th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the caster until he is affected by a Dispel Magic or Breach, all of the skins are removed by physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.

Iron Skins will not protect the caster from any area-effect magical attacks, such as Fireball. However, they will protect the caster from any secondary effects from physical attacks, such as fire, acid, or poison delivered by a weapon, and even magical on-hit effects such as Hold. They will also protect the caster against nonmaagical weapons and most ranged weapons. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative and the number of skins gained is not cumulative with those from a Stoneskin spell.

The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.

The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently. These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.
