Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes one target of the caster's choice. The creature struck by the ray sustains 1d3 points of fire damage plus 1d3 every two extra levels of experience (up to a maximum of 5d3). Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light suffer an extra 1d6 per two levels in addition to this, to a maximum total of 5d3 + 5d6. In addition, targets who fail a saving throw vs. spells are blinded for 3 rounds.

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The beneficiaries of this spell gain a slight, instinctive insight into the very immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to have unusually good luck in every regard, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions, for the next 5 rounds. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.

@22132 = ~Stinking Cloud

Level: 2
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Poison negates

When Stinking Cloud is cast, a billowing mass of nauseous vapors appears centered on a point selected by the caster. Each round a creature is within the cloud, <PRO_HISHER> movement rate is cut by 50% for two rounds. Additionally, if the <PRO_HESHE> fails a saving throw vs. death/poison, <PRO_HESHE> will become nauseated. Nauseated characters are unable to attack or cast spells for two rounds, and have 2-point penalties to armor class, to-hit rolls, and casting speed for four rounds. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, apart from the movement rate reduction; however, those who remain within the cloud must continue to save each round.  Certain creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud, including all undead and creatures who don't need to breathe, such as elementals.

@22152 = ~Web

Level: 2
School: Evocation
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 15 ft. in radius (roughly the same size as a Fireball). Creatures caught within the webs can become stuck among the gluey fibers; they must roll a saving throw every round. If the saving throw is successful, then the creature is free to move out of the area, though at a reduced (by half) movement speed. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs and are affected as if by a Slow spell: <PRO_HESHE> performs all actions at half the usual speed and suffers a -4 penalty to armor class, and additionally c annot make any physical attacks at all. This Slow effect is compounded by the movement speed penalty, so creatures who fail their saving throw can only move at one-quarter speed to escape the webbed area.

(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Breath Weapon

Similar to Mordenkainen's 'Force Missiles' variant, this is an attempt to improve on the basic Magic Missile spell. This version creates two missiles of sizzling magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4 points of magic damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage (the victim may save vs. Breath to avoid the fire damage). The spell will create three missiles at 4th level, four missiles at 6th level, five missiles at 8th level, and six missiles at 10th level.

The Shield spell will block this, just as it blocks the lesser Magic Missile spell.
~
@22512 = ~Decastave

Level: 2
School: Evocation
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d6 Hit Points of damage per hit, and it can hit creatures that require +1 weapons to hit. It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff releases sonic energy with each hit; the effect is not strong enough to do damage outright, but it can deafen the target for three rounds on a failed saving throw vs. spells. The Decastave also has a weak vampiric effect, draining a target of 1d2 Hit Points with every strike. These Hit Points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points beyond <PRO_HISHER> normal maximum.
~
@12022 = ~Barkskin

Level: 2
School: Alteration
Sphere: Plant
Range: Caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast upon a creature, its skin takes on the appearance of rough, woody bark. What's more, this bark-like texture continually grows to protect the recipient of the spell. The bark can completely turn aside a single blow (but not any magical secondary effects) and is chipped off in the process; one round later, the bark will regrow enough to block another blow. This process of protection and regrowth continues for 2 turns, protecting the recipient from one physical attack per round, after which the spell fades. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

@12071 = ~Goodberry~
@12072 = ~Goodberry

Level: 2
School: Alteration
Sphere: Plant
Range: 15 feet
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: party
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a bunch of enchanted berries to grow to unnatural size, and distributes them among <PRO_HISHER> allies. Each portion is as filling and nutritious as a full home-cooked meal, and the enchantment makes them unusually restorative: partaking of the berries eliminates intoxication, reduces fatigue, and causes the eater to regenerate 2 hit points per round, for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level (to a maximum of 20 hit points healed over 10 rounds).

Creating and eating the Goodberries can only be done outside of combat.

Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature

When this spell is cast upon a poisoned individual, it greatly slows the effects of venom, actually neutralizing all but the most deadly poisons. The effect remains in the target's body for a short time, preventing <PRO_HIMHER> from be affected by poison for three rounds after the spell is cast.

Level: 2
School: Divination
Sphere: Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps - concealed normally or magically - of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Once per round, all traps within a 30 foot radius of the caster will be revealed. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus, traps include glyphs and similar spells or devices.

(Invocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a silver-hued, partially ethereal lance shaped in the form of an alicorn (a unicorn horn). The caster chooses a target, and the alicorn lance instantaneously fires at it, inflicting 4d6 points of magic damage. Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to its Armor Class for 3 rounds.

@13512 = ~Moonblade

Level: 3
Sphere: Combat, Sun
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. Due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from Strength do not apply, but attacks with the moonblade are considered melee touch attacks, and thus gain a +4 bonus to hit.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage. There is a 50% chance that someone struck by the Moonblade will be affected by Faerie Fire if they fail a saving throw vs. spells, resulting in a 2-point penalty to armor class and preventing them from going invisible. Undead, who are particularly susceptible to the blade's radiant energy, take additional 1d12 points of damage and must make a saving throw or be Slowed for three rounds.

@25082 = ~Waves of Fatigue
Level: 5
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

Surges of negative energy render all hostile living creatures in the spell's area fatigued. Fatigued individuals have 2-point reductions to attacks rolls and damage dealt by weapons, and take 2 points per die more damage from enemy spells. Such individuals will also have any Haste effects removed. Furthermore, if someone affected by this spell fails a saving throw vs. petrification/polymorph, <PRO_HESHE> will also endure a 2-point penalty to all saving throws, a reduction of 1 attack per 2 rounds, and a 2-point penalty to spellcasting speed.
~
@25182 = ~Phantom Blade

Level: 5
School: Illusion
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the caster's hand. The silent, blade-shaped construct inflicts a combination of psychic/stunning damage and magic damage. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with it, at <PRO_HISHER> normal THAC0.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. Due to its etheric nature, it causes spellcasters struck to be unable to use magic for one round. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.

The air around the caster crackles with energy as up to ten Magic Missiles race toward each enemy within the area of effect. These are identical to Magic Missiles created by the 1st-level spell, in every respect: each one does 1d6+1 damage, and they are blocked by the Shield spell as well as anything else that would block the Magic Missile spell.

@27082 = ~Iron Skin

Level: 7
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: n/a

When this powerful spell is cast, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding the caster. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder <PRO_HIMHER> in no way. Five such protective skins are gained, plus one for every two levels of the caster. For example, a 10th level wizard would receive 10 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 15. Each skin will stop one physical attack and then disappear, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 10 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 11th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the caster until he is affected by a Dispel Magic or Breach, all of the skins are removed by physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.

Iron Skins will not protect the caster from any area-effect magical attacks, such as Fireball. However, they will protect the caster from any secondary effects from physical attacks, such as fire, acid, or poison delivered by a weapon, and even magical on-hit effects such as Hold. They will also protect the caster against nonmaagical weapons and most ranged weapons. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative and the number of skins gained is not cumulative with those from a Stoneskin spell.

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.

The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently. These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill. These effects last for 1 hour. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, and there is no saving throw to avoid the Drain.

When wizards and similar magic users become very powerful they may forge an arrangement with an extremely powerful denizen of the inner planes, whereby the creature, an elite noble genie, will assent to assist the wizard in the Prime Material Plane. Only one such arrangement may be made - in this case with a chaotic good Noble Djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. 

While it appears as though the genie is gated, in actuality it only generates a temporary vessel to act in this world. It has the abilities of a powerful fighter/priest, and carries an electrically charged sword.

As the arrows approached, Foik's hands would move of their own accord, either knocking the arrow away or catching it. He earned more than a few pieces of gold for his troubles, and these earnings attracted some shadowy figures to Foik's tent that evening.
